fireSearch is designed as an Extension for Google Chrome which helps you find
dance videos which are... well... fire. The extension allows you to automatically
create a Spotify Playlist of related, randomly generated songs and provides an in
Chrome Popup to display videos related to choreography involving the songs in the
playlist. This extension helps you find plenty of songs to choreograph to and videos
to inspire your choreography or interests as a dancer or a viewer.

You must have a valid Spotify account in order to use the app.

To use fireSearch, just highlight and write click a song name and select fireSearch,
a playlist will be automatically created with the name fireSearch. After it 
is created you should rename it to your liking. Then after you write click a song,
press the sF button in Chrome in the upper right hand corner to get a list of videos.
By holding 'ctrl' and clicking on the video it will open in a new tab.

Notes: 
If there is an error in login, searching Youtube or making a playlist an alert
will be created in your browser. 

fireSearch will by default create a ten song playlist, this can be adjusted by
changing the variables in the beginning of the background.js script.

fireSearch also by default creates a new playlist each time an item is clicked.
The playlist may be different even when the same song name is selected. The
playlist creation can be turned off by adjusting the value of MakeSpotifyPlaylist
from true (default) to false. This will still display the YouTube results in the
popup window.

After a few minutes the YouTube results will disappear from the popup and when 
clicked a small blank window will disappear.
